def ranges_to_set(ranges, reference):
    """
    Returns a set of integers based of ranges over a reference list. Ranges are
    inclusive both in the lower and upper bound, unlike in python where they are
    inclusive only in the lower but not the upper bound.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ranges : str
        a list of ranges represented by a string. Each range is comma separated.
        A range is a couple of integers colon separated.
        If the index 0 in not present in the list, it is automatically added.
    reference : list
        the reference list. It is used in case of negative indexing.
